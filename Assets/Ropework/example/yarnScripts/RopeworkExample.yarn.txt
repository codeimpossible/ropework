Eve: Tell me Adam, how long have you been working with us here at RPT Studios?
Adam: This is my second year as a coder here, I think.
Adam: ...
Adam: Is that it? Can't this wait until later?
Adam: Some of us have games to make, you know.
Eve: And would you say that you're doing good work? Without any distractions? Is everything OK at home?
Adam: Well it was shaky at first, with the divorce and everything. 
Adam: But ever since I went in on that two bedroom with Steve, it's been great.

Eve: How would you characterize your relationship with Steve?
Adam: Huh? Why? You think we're gay or something?

-> Eve: No, I mean your professional relationship.
	Eve: ... Uh, what?
	Eve: No, I'm talking about your professional relationship.
	Adam: But come to think of it, I've been thinking about Steve a lot lately...
	Eve: That's nice, but about your work --
	Adam: His eyes are like a... 
	Eve: ... like a tiger in the moonlight?
	Adam: Yeah! And his ass is like an 18-wheeler lost in a sewer. 
	Eve: You're on your own with that one.
	Adam: Oh my god, maybe I really am gay. This meeting's been a real eye-opener.
	<<Shake @ Adam, 0.5>>

	Eve: Gayer than a brunch in July.
	Adam: Oh my god. Is it that obvious?
	-> Eve: Duh.
	-> Eve: No, not at all!
	Eve: Don't worry about it.
	Eve: Besides, you and Steve look cute together, always blowing kisses at each other when you think no one's watching.
	Adam: You knew about that?
	Eve: And the whole office knows it was you two who broke the table in the breakroom.
	Adam: What kind of table can't withstand a few thrusting motions? 
	Adam: ... It was ugly anyway.
	Eve: The table.
	Adam: Yes, the table.
-> Eve: Maybe it really was Adam and Steve.
	Eve: Hey, what Adam and Steve do in their two bedroom condo is none of my business.
	Adam: Damn straight.
	Adam: ... I mean, I am. Straight. That is.
	Eve: Understood.
	Adam: Completely. Heterosexual. No gay thoughts here.
	Eve: Right.
	Adam: I saw a boob once --

Eve: Hey! This isn't about you being gay! I'm gay too! I don't care!
Adam: Are you gay like a brunch in July?
-> Eve: Gay like a tiger in the moonlight.
